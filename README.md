# HTML-basics

Welcome to your guide for learning the basics of HTML and passing a set of tests that check the structure of your HTML code. HTML is the language used to create web pages, and it's an excellent skill to have.

## Getting Started

Before we dive into the tests, you'll need to set up your environment to run them. We'll be using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework, along with JSDOM, a library that allows us to work with the Document Object Model (DOM) in Node.js. To install these tools, open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install jest
npm install jsdom

## Test 1: Page Title

### Create a Page Title

- Create a `<title>` element.
- Within the `<title>` element, set the text to "My First Web Page."

## Test 2: The Header

### Create the Header

- Create a `<div>` element with the class "header."
- Inside the "header" div, create an `<h1>` element.
- Inside the `<h1>` element, set the text to "Welcome to My Web Page."

## Test 3: The Navigation

### Create the Navigation

- Create a `<div>` element with the class "nav."
- Inside the "nav" div, create an unordered list (`<ul>`).
- Inside the unordered list, create three list items (`<li>` elements).

## Test 4: The Main Content

### Create the Main Content

- Create a `<div>` element with the class "main."
- Inside the "main" div, create an `<h2>` element for the main heading.
- Inside the "main" div, create a `<p>` element for text content.

## Test 5: Lists

### Create Lists

- Create a `<div>` element with the class "lists."
- Inside the "lists" div, create an ordered list (`<ol>`) with list items (`<li>` elements).
- Inside the "lists" div, create an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>` elements).

That's it! Follow these steps to create your HTML code, and you'll pass all the tests. If you have any questions or need help, don't hesitate to ask. Happy coding!
