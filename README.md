# HTML-basics

Welcome to your guide for learning the basics of HTML and passing a set of tests that check the structure of your HTML code. HTML is the language used to create web pages, and it's an excellent skill to have.

## Getting Started
If this is your first time install node with this command otherwise skip

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
nvm
nvm install --lts
nvm list
```
Before we dive into the tests, you'll need to set up your environment to run them. We'll be using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework, along with JSDOM, a library that allows us to work with the Document Object Model (DOM) in Node.js. To install these tools, open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install jest
npm install jsdom
```
You can run each test with it's number 
```bash
 npx jest -t '(number 1)'
 npx jest -t '(number 2)'
 npx jest -t '(number 3)'
 npx jest -t '(number 4)'
 npx jest -t '(number 5)'
```
Or run them all together with this command
```bash
npx jest testingFile.test.js
```

## Test 1: Page Title

### Create a Page Title

- Create a `<title>` element.
- Within the `<title>` element, set the text to "My First Web Page."

## Test 2: The Header

### Create the Header

- Create a `<div>` element with the class "header."
- Inside the "header" div, create an `<h1>` element.
- Inside the `<h1>` element, set the text to "Welcome to My Web Page."

## Test 3: The Navigation

### Create the Navigation

- Create a `<div>` element with the class "nav."
- Inside the "nav" div, create an unordered list (`<ul>`).
- Inside the unordered list, create three list items (`<li>` elements).

## Test 4: The Main Content

### Create the Main Content

- Create a `<div>` element with the class "main."
- Inside the "main" div, create an `<h2>` element for the main heading.
- Inside the "main" div, create a `<p>` element for text content.

## Test 5: Lists

### Create Lists

- Create a `<div>` element with the class "lists."
- Inside the "lists" div, create an ordered list (`<ol>`) with list items (`<li>` elements).
- Inside the "lists" div, create an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>` elements).

## HTML tags for reference

1. `<!DOCTYPE>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used.

2. `<html>`: The root element that contains all other HTML elements on the page.

3. `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title and links to external resources.

4. `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

5. `<meta>`: Provides metadata about the HTML document, such as character encoding and author information.

6. `<link>`: Used to link external resources, like CSS stylesheets, to the HTML document.

7. `<style>`: Defines inline CSS styles for specific elements on the page.

8. `<script>`: Used to include JavaScript code in the HTML document.

9. `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the web page, including text, images, and other elements.

10. `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>`: Headings of decreasing importance, with `<h1>` being the most important and `<h6>` the least.

11. `<p>`: Represents a paragraph of text.

12. `<a>`: Creates hyperlinks to other web pages or resources.

13. `<img>`: Embeds images in the web page.

14. `<ul>`: Defines an unordered list, often used with `<li>` elements.

15. `<ol>`: Defines an ordered list, where list items are automatically numbered.

16. `<li>`: List item element, used within `<ul>` and `<ol>` to define individual list items.

17. `<div>`: A generic container element often used for grouping and styling content.

18. `<span>`: A generic inline container element for applying styles or scripting to a specific portion of text.

19. `<br>`: Inserts a line break, useful for breaking text onto the next line without starting a new paragraph.

That's it! Follow these steps to create your HTML code, and you'll pass all the tests. If you have any questions or need help, don't hesitate to ask. Happy coding!
